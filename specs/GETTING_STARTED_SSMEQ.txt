GETTING STARTED
Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematical Electrical Quantities (SSMEQ)
Version: 2.0
Date: November 14, 2025
Caution: Research/observation only. Not for critical decision-making.

Goal
Emit and verify SSMEQ electrical records without changing existing telemetry.

Day-1: Add symbolic fields beside your volts, amps, watts.

Day-7: Publish what you promise (manifest + canonical subset).

Day-30: Let analytics, alarms, and audits use the symbolic layer.

Prerequisites

Attachment point.
A place to carry extra fields beside raw telemetry (new columns in CSV, extra tags in a message bus, JSON fields, etc.).

UTC clock (optional, for stamping).
Used if you also attach continuity stamps via SSM-Clock / SSM-Clock Stamp.

A published manifest_id defining:

Anchors and scales: V_ref, I_ref, f_ref, pf_ref, P_scale, THD_ref.

Lenses for zero-centric contrasts:

e_V := ln( V_rms / V_ref )

e_I := ln( I_rms / I_ref )

e_f := ln( f / f_ref )

e_P := asinh( P / P_scale )

Health dials (optional): a_pf, a_THD, limit dials such as a_upper, a_lower.

Residuals:

r_P := e_P_meas - ( e_V + e_I + ln( pf / pf_ref ) )

Bands and cutpoints over e_Q or a_Q (for example, GREEN/AMBER/RED).

Canonical subset recipe for sha256=... commitment (which fields are committed, in what order, with what newline and whitespace rules).

Day-1 — Emit Minimal SSMEQ Records (Sidecar Only)

Sender MUST

Preserve raw telemetry.
Do not change existing channels such as V_rms, I_rms, P, f, pf, THD.

Attach the following symbolic fields (names illustrative):

e_V: zero-centric voltage contrast (e_V := ln( V_rms / V_ref ))

e_I: zero-centric current contrast (e_I := ln( I_rms / I_ref ))

e_f: zero-centric frequency contrast (e_f := ln( f / f_ref ))

e_P: zero-centric power contrast (e_P := asinh( P / P_scale ))

r_P: power consistency residual (r_P := e_P_meas - ( e_V + e_I + ln( pf / pf_ref ) ))

band_P: label such as "GREEN", "AMBER", "RED" derived from e_P, r_P, and dials as per the manifest

manifest_id: profile name used to compute all of the above

Optionally attach integrity and continuity fields (if enabled by policy):

ssmeq-commit: sha256=<hex>

ssmeq-stamp: SSMCLOCK1|<iso_utc>|nonce=<...>|sha256=<...>|prev=<...>

Compute canonical subset commitment, for example:

bytes := JOIN_WITH_NEWLINES([
  timestamp,
  channel_id,
  e_V,
  e_I,
  e_P,
  r_P,
  band_P,
  manifest_id
])
sha256 := SHA256(bytes)


Attach this digest as ssmeq-commit: sha256=<hex> if you want verifiable evidence.

Receiver SHOULD

Recompute SHA256(canonical_subset) from the SSMEQ record and match ssmeq-commit (if present).

Verify bands:

Check that band_P is consistent with the manifest’s cutpoints over e_P, r_P, and any dials.

Record the SSMEQ envelope for replay:

At minimum, store timestamp, channel_id, e_*, r_P, band_P, manifest_id, and (if used) sha256 and stamp.

Day-7 — Publish What You Promise

By Day-7, you should make SSMEQ replayable by third parties:

Publish the manifest and canonical subset recipe.

Anchors: V_ref, I_ref, f_ref, pf_ref, P_scale, THD_ref.

Lenses, dials, residuals, and band rules.

Canonical subset ordering, whitespace, newline, and encoding rules.

Host a policy shelf containing versioned manifests (for example, PLANT_A.LV_FEEDERS.v1, PLANT_A.LV_FEEDERS.v2).

Begin applying an acceptance checklist on inbound SSMEQ data:

Required fields present (e_V, e_I, e_P, r_P, manifest_id, etc.).

If ssmeq-commit is present:

sha256 matches computed canonical subset bytes.

band_P matches the manifest’s published cutpoints for the given e_*, a_*, and r_P.

manifest_id is recognized.

If ssmeq-stamp is present:

prev chain continuity is consistent under SSM-Clock policy.

Day-30 — Enforce and Verify

By Day-30, the symbolic layer becomes active for decisions (while raw telemetry remains as a safety lane):

Apply actions based on bands.

For example, for band_P = RED, trigger alarms or advisory actions per local policy.

For persistent r_P drift, schedule inspection of CT/PTs or wiring.

If stamps are enabled, append observation stamps at key aggregation points:

Always append-only; never rewrite ssmeq-commit or existing stamps.

Store evidence bundles (if you are running formal evidence packs):

envelopes.jsonl — one canonical subset per line.

hashes.txt — list of sha256 hex digests.

checkpoint.txt — HEAD=<64hex> for the last digest.

verify.sh — script to recompute digests and print ALL CHECKS PASSED or a structured failure report.

Reference Snippets

Zero-Centric Lenses

e_V := ln( V_rms / V_ref )
e_I := ln( I_rms / I_ref )
e_f := ln( f / f_ref )
e_P := asinh( P / P_scale )


Power Residual

r_P := e_P_meas - ( e_V + e_I + ln( pf / pf_ref ) )


Health Dials (illustrative)

a_pf  := clamp( pf, -1+eps_a, +1-eps_a )
a_THD := tanh( c_THD * ln( 1 + THD/THD_ref ) )


Fused Dial Alignment Pipeline (optional for combined health)

a_c    := clamp( a_raw, -1+eps_a, +1-eps_a )
u      := atanh( a_c )
U     += w*u
W     += w
a_fused := tanh( U / max(W, eps_w) )


Tolerance notes:

eps_a > 0 and eps_w > 0 prevent edge pathologies (for example, atanh(±1), divide-by-zero).

Choose display precision appropriate to your serializer; verification binds canonical subset bytes, not your UI formatting.

Troubleshooting
Condition	Treatment
sha256 mismatch	Quarantine declaration; preserve raw telemetry.
Missing e_* or r_P	Treat record as non-SSMEQ or partial; do not rely on bands.
Unknown manifest_id	Hold until manifest is fetched; do not infer anchors or cutpoints.
band_P inconsistent	Flag as policy violation; recompute band from e_* and r_P.
Broken stamp chain	Accept payload; mark declaration non-evidential (if stamps are in use).
Wire / Storage Format Guidance

Use ASCII-safe field names.

Keep case-exact values for manifest_id and bands.

When computing ssmeq-commit, canonical subset bytes must be byte-accurate, not pretty-printed differently across systems.

Security & Clock Hygiene (if using stamps)

stamp is tamper-evident, not a substitute for channel encryption or authentication.

Use UTC with a trailing Z (for example, 2025-11-14T10:02:11Z).

Skew tolerance (for example, ±120 seconds) is a manifest / policy choice.

Versioning

Increment manifest_id when anchors, lenses, band cutpoints, or disclosure rules change.

Keep the canonical subset recipe stable across minor manifest revisions when possible.

If the canonical subset itself changes → mint a new manifest_id.

Testing Loop

Generate an SSMEQ record with e_*, r_P, bands, and manifest_id.

Compute sha256 over the canonical subset and attach as ssmeq-commit.

Run verify.sh against the evidence bundle (if used).

Expect ALL CHECKS PASSED or a clear failure reason.

One-Line Takeaway
The volts, amps, and watts never change.
The electrical story becomes zero-centric, replayable, and verifiable for everyone who shares the manifest.
